#Huffman Encoding in Python.

For the explanation of the [Encoding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsTptu56GM8&t=283s).

There are 2 files:
*   efficient_version.py - by [Siddharth Shekhar](https://github.com/Sid0518)
*   readable_version.py - by ME!

The efficient version takes a bit less space and less time.
Whereas the readable version is more readable as it has classes for everything instead of lots of nested lists.
